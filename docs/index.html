                &emsp;I am a student at Gonzaga University majoring in computer science and mathematics. 
                I grew up on a wheat and cattle ranch outside of Rufus, OR. Hardwork and commitment 
                are two values very important to me. I am on track to graduate with my BS in computer 
                science in June 2023, and with my BS in mathematics in August 2023. As of right now, 
                I plan to persue graduate studies in math with the ultimate goal of obtaining a PhD. My passion 
                for math developed in my research experience at Gonzaga
                and during my REU in the summer of 2022.
                However, I also have interests in working in consulting for software development. I believe
                that my strong mathematical reasoning and programming skills will allow me to be successful 
                beyond my undergraduate studies.
